# Memory Consumption Script (PowerShell Version)

This PowerShell script installs Python (if necessary) and executes a Python script designed to consume a large amount of memory on a computer by creating a large array. It can be used for testing purposes or to simulate memory-intensive scenarios. Please exercise caution when running this script as it may impact the performance of your system.

## Requirements

- PowerShell (5.1 or above)
- Python (3.6 or above)
- NumPy library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/charanravi-online/memory-consumption.bat.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```
cd memory-consumption.bat
```

3. Run the bat file by clicking on it [Windows]:

```
memory-consumption.bat
```

4. The PowerShell script will handle the installation of Python (if necessary) and the installation of the NumPy library.


5. After the installations are completed, the Python script will be executed, which allocates a large amount of memory and continues to hold it until manually interrupted.


6. Use caution when running this script and ensure you have sufficient available memory to avoid impacting the performance of your system.
